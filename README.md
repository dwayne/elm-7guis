# 7GUIs in Elm - [Use App](https://dwayne.github.io/elm-7guis)

[7GUIs](https://7guis.github.io/7guis/) is a GUI programming benchmark where implementations are compared in terms of their notation. It defines [seven tasks](https://7guis.github.io/7guis/tasks/) that represent typical challenges in GUI programming.

[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is "*A delightful language for reliable web applications.*" Technically, it's a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It is intentionally designed from the ground up to help you make websites and web apps.

Elm is well-suited for **UI development** and **domain modeling** as is illustrated by the implementations of the [Circle Drawer](#circle-drawer) and [Cells](#cells) tasks.
